# copy-to-clipboard utility function for code blocks in MDX

I thought that implementing a simple copy-to-clipboard functionality for code blocks for this blog would be straight forward but actually it requires a bit of work.

## My approach

I am using MDX and have installed the <SmallCodeBlock content='next-mdx-remote' /> and the <SmallCodeBlock content='rehype-highlight' /> packages. More info on how I set up my blog [here](https://gaudion.dev/blog/nextjs-mdx-blog).

Since this blog is tech based I have the needs of providing code snippets to the readers. The normal MDX code block is pretty good for my use cases, the only tweaks I made is adding a little bit of border-radius and the syntax highlight of the package I mentioned above.

A feature I have seen on nearly all of the tech blog posts is the "copy-to-clipboard" button, usually on the top right of the code block like this:

<CodeBlock>
```javascript
const randomFunction = () => {
    console.log("copy me by clicking the icon on the top right of this block!")
}
```
</CodeBlock>

So I created a custom <SmallCodeBlock content='CodeBlock' /> component, that would accept the children (the actual mdx code block) as props. The first time I tried to use it was like this:

```
<CodeBlock>
` ` `
npm install @supabase/ssr @supabase/supabase-js
` ` ` 
</CodeBlock>
```

Don&apos;t mind the spacing in the ticks above, it is for practical purposes for displaying the code to you. So, the <SmallCodeBlock content='CodeBlock' /> component would accept the <SmallCodeBlock content='children' /> as a prop. On the click of a button, a <SmallCodeBlock content='copyToClipboard'/> function would trigger.

The function would simply do this:
<CodeBlock>
```javascript
 const copyToClipboard = async () => {
    try {
      await navigator.clipboard.writeText(children);
    } catch (err) {
      console.error("Failed to copy!", err);
    }
  };
```
</CodeBlock>

So, that didn&apos;t go as expected. The copied value when I tried to paste it would be <SmallCodeBlock content='[Object Object]' />

After a little bit of tweeking, I found out that the object copied was like this:

<CodeBlock>
```
{
    "type": "pre",
    "key": null,
    "ref": null,
    "props": {
        "children": {
            "type": "code",
            "key": null,
            "ref": null,
            "props": {
                "className": "hljs language-bash",
                "children": "npm install @supabase/ssr @supabase/supabase-js\n"
            },
            "_owner": null,
            "_store": {}
        }
    },
    "_owner": null,
    "_store": {}
}
```
</CodeBlock>

Notice that the <SmallCodeBlock content='props' /> has a <SmallCodeBlock content='children' /> property, which in turn has another <SmallCodeBlock content='props' /> in it. And this is for just one line of code! The pattern continues when you add more lines to your MDX code block. We got a bare bones React element represented in JSON format! I am not gonna go too deep on this, but there are a lot of articles covering this subject. I will [link](https://www.zipy.ai/blog/how-react-works-under-the-hood) one of them for you here.


## The solution

So I had to destructure this object and create a string representing each line. Even right now writing these lines, I think there could be other solutions for this problem, but here is mine.

By "mine" I mean here is the solution I came up with the help of Chat-GPT. It&apos;s not cheating, go use it for your problems.

<CodeBlock>
```javascript
  const extractText = (node) => {
    if (typeof node === "string") {
      return node;
    } else if (React.isValidElement(node) && node.props) {
      if (Array.isArray(node.props.children)) {
        return node.props.children.map(extractText).join("");
      } else {
        return extractText(node.props.children);
      }
    }
    return "";
  };

  const codeString = extractText(children);
```
</CodeBlock>

The above function checks if the node (in our case, the children we pass as props to our component) is a string then returns it. If not, we check if the node is a React element and if it has props. We proceed to recursively extract the text from the children(check the React element in JSON format above).

And that&apos;s it! Here is the full <SmallCodeBlock content='CodeBlock' /> component that I am using in my blog that you are reading right now. The below CodeBlock component will be rendered to you using the CodeBlock component!

**Small note**: I am using <SmallCodeBlock content='framer-motion' /> for animations, feel free to remove these pieces of code, or use them too if you will.
<CodeBlock>
```javascript
"use client";
import React, { useState } from "react";
import { AnimatePresence, motion } from "framer-motion";

const CodeBlock = ({ children }) => {
  const [isCopied, setIsCopied] = useState(false);

  // Function to recursively extract text from children
  const extractText = (node) => {
    if (typeof node === "string") {
      return node;
    } else if (React.isValidElement(node) && node.props) {
      if (Array.isArray(node.props.children)) {
        return node.props.children.map(extractText).join("");
      } else {
        return extractText(node.props.children);
      }
    }
    return "";
  };

  const codeString = extractText(children);

  const copyToClipboard = async () => {
    try {
      await navigator.clipboard.writeText(codeString);
      setIsCopied(true);
      setTimeout(() => setIsCopied(false), 500); // Reset the copied state after 2 seconds
    } catch (err) {
      console.error("Failed to copy!", err);
    }
  };

  // Image transition animations
  const imageTransition = {
    opacity: isCopied ? 1 : 0.5,
    scale: isCopied ? 1.2 : 1,
    transition: { duration: 0.2 },
  };

  // Fancy text animation
  const textAnimation = {
    initial: { opacity: 0, y: 0, x: 0, rotate: 0, x: 10 },
    animate: { opacity: 1, y: -20, x: 10 },
    exit: { opacity: 0, y: -50, x: 10 },
    transition: { duration: 1, ease: "easeIn" },
  };

  return (
    <div className="relative">
      {children}
      <motion.img
        className="absolute top-2 right-2 not-prose cursor-pointer"
        onClick={() => {
          if (!isCopied) copyToClipboard();
        }}
        src={isCopied ? "/icons/clipboardCheck.svg" : "/icons/clipboard.svg"}
        animate={imageTransition}
      />

      <AnimatePresence>
        {isCopied && (
          <motion.div
            className="absolute top-0 right-2 text-sm"
            initial="initial"
            animate="animate"
            exit="exit"
            variants={textAnimation}
          >
            Copied
          </motion.div>
        )}
      </AnimatePresence>
    </div>
  );
};

export default CodeBlock;

```
</CodeBlock>
