# copy-to-clipboard utility function for code blocks in MDX

I thought that implementing a simple copy-to-clipboard functionality for code blocks for this blog would be straight forward but actually it requires a bit of work.

## My approach

I am using MDX and have installed the <SmallCodeBlock content='next-mdx-remote' /> and the <SmallCodeBlock content='rehype-highlight' /> packages. More info on how I set up my blog [here](https://gaudion.dev/blog/nextjs-mdx-blog)
