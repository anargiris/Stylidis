  Setting up Authentication/Authorization in NextJS app router with Supabase
</h1>

<h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Intro </h2>
<p>
  I took the time to write this blog to help people &#40;and myself in the
  future&#41; setting up auth/authorization in their NextJS/Supabase projects.
</p>

<p>After the NextJS transition to the app router, the paradigm shift has left a lot of people wondering on how to do things correctly. React Server Components, "use client" and the damned hydration errors among others made a lot of devs wonder if they should transition to other solutions &#40;Sveltekit, HTMX, Vue, Angular&#41;.</p>
```javascript
export function myComponent() {
  return <p>test</p>;
}
```
