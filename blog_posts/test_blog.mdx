# Setting up Authentication/Authorization in NextJS app router with Supabase

### Intro

I took the time to write this blog to help people &#40;and myself in the
future&#41; setting up auth/authorization in their NextJS/Supabase projects.

After the NextJS transition to the app router, the paradigm shift has left a
lot of people wondering on how to do things correctly. React Server
Components, "use client" and the damned hydration errors among others made a
lot of devs wonder if they should transition to other solutions
&#40;Sveltekit, HTMX, Vue, Angular&#41;.

For the sake of this tutorial, I am assuming you already have a NextJS project
set up together with a Supabase instance. If you don't, here are some links to
help you get started:

**NextJS Getting started:** [Link](https://nextjs.org/learn-pages-router/basics/create-nextjs-app/setup)

**Supabase Getting started:** [Link](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started)

### Setting up

The Supabase team has been fast in adapting to the app router and created the new <SmallCodeBlock content={"@supabase-ssr"} /> package migrating from their older <SmallCodeBlock content={"@auth-helpers"} />. So let's get started!

Open the terminal in your application and type:
<CodeBlock>
```bash
npm install @supabase/ssr @supabase/supabase-js
```
</CodeBlock>
This will install the dependencies we are going to use for our example.
<CodeBlock>
```javascript
export function myComponent() {
  return <p>test</p>;
}
```
</CodeBlock>
